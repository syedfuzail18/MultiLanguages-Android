# MultiLanguages-Android / Localization-Android

Please use Development branch to check the latest code..

We have used 3 languages in the example you can use multiple.

We have just created 3 images and on clicking them we change our resources you can use anything like RecyclerView, Spinner, etc etc to select a language.

You have to create values folder according to the language
For Example:
If we are having spanish language we have created values-es, for Hindi we have use values-hi (Refer to the example)
These are predifined symbols in android you can look for them and use them accordingly, by default English is the language which is set in android.
